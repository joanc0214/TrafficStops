# NC Traffic Stop Patterns

## Overview
This project explores patterns and disparities in North Carolina traffic stops using publicly available state data. It focuses on understanding 
trends related to driver demographics, outcomes of stops, and how these vary across time and counties. The analysis combines **exploratory data 
analysis (EDA)** with **statistical visualization** to uncover insights about potential racial disparities and enforcement patterns.

## Project Components
You can view the full analysis and findings through the following interactive reports:
- [Exploratory Data Analysis (HTML Report)]()
- [Final Paper and Visualizations (HTML Report)]()
